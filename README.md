# Waveshare E-Paper Display library for Pycom MicroPython

This library is based on the original Waveshare library for Raspberry Pi, available [here](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.54inch_e-Paper_Module_(B)).

At the moment it supports 1.54" Waveshare two-color E-Paper Display only.

## Usage

Consult `main.py` for an example usage.
In order to use fonts, copy them to `epd/lib` directory, or (recommended) freeze them in firmware. See [this blog post](http://kapusta.cc/epd) for more info on how to do it.
